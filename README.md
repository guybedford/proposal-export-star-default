# ECMAScript Proposal: Include default export in `export * from 'module'`

**Stage:** 0

**Author:** Guy Bedford

**Reviewers:** Caridy PatiÃ±o

**Specification:** http://guybedford.github.io/proposal-export-star-default/

## Motivation

In the current specification, `export * from 'module'` will export all named exports, **except for
the default export**.

There are use cases though where it is useful to be able to have the `default` export defined within
an internal private module, and have that exposed through `export *`.

### 1. Symmetry with named exports

Consider a module X with both a named export and a default export that is re-exported through another module
(reexport1.js and reexport2.js in this example). If we explicitly list its export names when re-exporting them,
then we can import everything as expected. But if we use `export *` the default export is not accessible.

x.js
```javascript
export default 'default';
export let name = 'name';
```

Re-exporting with explicit names:

reexport1.js
```javascript
export { name, default } from './x.js';
```

```javascript
import { name } from './reexport1.js';
import { default } from './reexport1.js';

import * as A from './reexport1.js';
A.default;
// -> 'default'
```

While if we use `export *` we get:

reexport2.js
```javascript
export * from './x.js';
```

```javascript
import { name } from './reexport2.js';
import { default } from './reexport2.js';
// Syntax Error: 'default' is not exported

import * as B from './reexport2.js';
B.default
// -> undefined
```

_This breaks the the user intuition that `default` is a named export like any other._

### 2. Creating a top-level index module

A convention in NodeJS is to have an `index.js` which is the main entry point of the package.

If we want to create this module using `export *` statements to expose modules from sub-folders, we
cannot export the default in this way:

index.js
```javascript
export * from './lib/package-core.js';
export let extraInfo = 'abc';
```

If `lib/package-core.js` contained a default export, we would not be exposing it.

We would need to explitly export the default with something like:

index.js
```javascript
export * from './lib/package-core.js';
export { default } from './lib/package-core.js';
export let extraInfo = 'abc';
```

_The issue here is that if we were ever to remove the default export from
`lib/package-core.js`, we would then get a SyntaxError in `index.js` that the
default export does not exist anymore. The change of removing the default export
would need to be made in two separate places._

The above pattern is also already widely seen in `index.js` modules on npm, of the form:

```javascript
module.exports = require('./lib/package.js');
```

where we know that the `index.js` module will then exactly match the internal module.

### 3. Dynamic wrapping

The case for reexporting the defaut can also be extended to use cases where we want to dynamically
generate a module wrapper exposing the same exports as another module, without knowing in advance its export names.

Consider a use case such as an npm CDN, which allows shortcut URLs like `https://npmcdn.com/lodash`,
which then expose a module at a full versioned URL like `https://npmcdn.com/lodash@4.17.2/index.js`.

A dynamically generated module for `https://npmcdn.com/lodash` could look like:

```javascript
export * from './lodash@4.17.2/index.js';
```

but if there was a default export we would have to provide a different response:

```javascript
export * from './lodash@4.17.2/index.js';
export { default } from './lodash@4.17.2/index.js';
```

_If we don't include the default export when it is needed, we may miss the `default`, and if do we include
it when it isn't needed, we will get an error. This restriction has thus added a new static analysis
concern to what would otherwise be a simple server response._

## Proposal

The proposal is to remove special-casing of `default` for `export *` in the current specification
in order to simplify the symmetry of `export *` as well as to enable easier module wrapping use cases as described above.

The change is backwards-compatible with the existing specification and results in disabling the syntax error for importing
a default export through an `export *`, and making `default` available as a named export on the module namespace object for this case.

## Handling Ambiguity

One concern with including `default` in `export *` is how to handle collisions, but `export *`
is already designed to handle ambiguity well - when two `export *` statements in a module resolve the
same export name, a SyntaxError is thrown as in [15.2.1.16.4 12.d.ii)](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-moduledeclarationinstantiation):

  x.js
  ```javascript
  export default 'x';
  export let name = 'nameX';
  ```

  y.js
  ```javascript
  export default 'y';
  export let name = 'nameY';
  ```

  z.js
  ```javascript
  export * from './x.js';
  export * from './y.ys';
  ```

When we try to import `name` via

  ```javascript
  import { name } from './z.js';
  ```

we will get a SyntaxError that name is ambiguous.

This conflict can be resolved though by explicitly selecting a module to export from

  z.js
  ```javascript
  export * from './x.js';
  export * from './y.ys';
  export { name } from './x.js';
  ```

Now when we import `name`, it is correctly resolved.

With this spec change, the same ambiguity resolution process would apply to the default export:

  ```javascript
  import { default } from './z.js';
  ```

would throw a SyntaxError.

  z.js
  ```javascript
  export * from './x.js';
  export * from './y.ys';
  export { default } from './x.js';
  ```

would then resolve that SyntaxError by providing an explicit precedence, providing symmetry between handling conflicts between named exports
and default exports via `export *`.
